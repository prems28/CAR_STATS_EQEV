🚗 Android Automotive – Car Property & VHAL Integration Demo
This project demonstrates how to work with Android Automotive Car APIs to interact with Vehicle HAL (VHAL) using CarPropertyManager.

The application starts automatically after vehicle boot and runs as a background service. It establishes a connection with the car system, registers required vehicle property IDs, retrieves default values from VHAL, and listens for real-time property changes. When a vehicle property changes, the app processes the update and forwards the signal to a repository layer for further handling, such as UI updates or business logic.

The architecture is designed to be modular and scalable by using a base property handler abstraction. This allows new vehicle properties to be added easily without modifying the core logic. The project also supports sending commands from the application back to the vehicle by setting VHAL properties.

This project is an Android Automotive OS demo application that showcases how to interact with Vehicle HAL (VHAL) using the Car API and CarPropertyManager.

The application runs as a background service, starts automatically after system boot, and listens to vehicle property changes in real time. It also demonstrates how to send commands from the application back to the vehicle using VHAL properties.

The architecture is modular, scalable, and production-oriented, making it suitable for OEM-level Android Automotive development.
